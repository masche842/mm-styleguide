Styleguide Engine
=================

This is an engine to add a dead simple way of making a project wide
styleguide for all things css and design


Installation
============

Currently this needs a little more manual setup, we'll eventually add
generators to it.

After adding the plugin to the Gemfile like this:

gem 'mm-styleguide', :git => "http://github.com/mindmatters/mm-styleguide.git", :lib => 'styleguide'

just bundle.

After that, you need a few folders and files to get going:

Your styleguide files go here (these are plain rails view files):

app/views/styleguide/

Apart from the views, you'll also need a partial named _head, where
you should insert all the stylsheet requires you are having in your
application layouts. Take a look at the rails app in test/fixtures/rails_app
if you have any questions.
